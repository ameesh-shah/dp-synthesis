New Interfaces for Data Programming, via Program Synthesis Techniques 

The notebook SpamTube_Sandbox will start out with a simple tutorial of how to use LFs in the WRENCH system.
We provide a simple API, in labelfunction.py, with which you can interface to provide your own LFs to WRENCH in an easy way.

The tutorial uses the YouTube Spam dataset from the wrench paper. Please make a directory "data" and put the "youtube" directory 
available on WRENCH in 'data' (i.e. 'data/youtube/') to run the pynb.
